CITATION

## General note
The data sets for the scripts to be executed are in a separate OSF repository, because they are too large to be hosted on GitHub. Therefore, to run the code, after downloading this repository please download the data folder contained in the aforementioned OSF repository and copy it into the main directory of this repository (i.e. on the same level as the code, plots and tables folders).

## Reproduction of analysis
The repository is organized into two sections ``data`` and ``analysis``. 

* ``data`` contains exemplary scripts for the data collection, wrangling, text processing and non-parametric matching. The resulting datasets are used for the statistical analysis. _Note._ Most of these steps cannot be reproduced. 
* In ``analysis``, you will find the scripts to reproduce the results of the statistical analysis. The datasets used for each analysis can be found [HERE].
